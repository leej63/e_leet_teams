Instead of taking questions and trying to solve them on your own, why not learn them with others who are striving to a similar goal with a competitive spirit. Whether you are practicing algorithms for interviews or aiming to sharpen your skills, why not do it in a way that fosters a bit of competition and excitement. Compare your skills to others with a similar level and race to the correct solution. Collaborate with your with your teammates to find the ideal solution to the algorithm within the given timeframe to beat the opposing team; the process of working together to find a solution is the most effective way of learning. Our application is for programmers of all levels, whether you are a beginner or an experienced engineer, there is a challenge for you on our platform. Choose your difficulty level that best fits your needs but make sure it is still a challenge! We aim to foster a community that promotes friendly competition to learn algorithms in a new way.
